PyCity Schools Challenge

1. Project Overview and Purpose: This project involves analyzing student and financial data from a local school district to assist in making informed strategic decisions about future school budgets and priorities. The analysis will include aggregating standardized test results to identify trends in school performance.

2. Dataset Description: The data for this project is contained in two separate Microsoft Excel (MS Excel) files located in the Resources folder:
  schools_complete.xls: Contains information on school identification (ID number and name), type, size, and budget.
  students_complete.xls: Contains student identification (ID number and name), gender, grade, school name, and standardized test scores in reading and math.

3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: No data cleaning was necessary before starting the analysis, as the dataset had no missing or incomplete information.

4. Data Visualization Techniques: DataFrames were created to present the analysis in a tabular format. Additionally, tabular data in the form of .csv files were generated upon request.
5. Results and Analysis:
 (a) Key Findings:
District Summary:
  Total number of unique schools
  Total number of students
  Total budget
  Average (mean) math score
  Average (mean) reading score
  Percentage of students who passed math
  Percentage of students who passed reading
  Percentage of students who passed both math and reading

School Summary:
  Total student count
  Per capita spending
  Average test scores
  Number of schools with math scores of 70 or higher
  Number of schools with reading scores of 70 or higher
  Schools with passing rates of 70 or higher in both math and reading
  Additional Analyses:

Highest-Performing Schools by Percentage of Overall Passing
Lowest-Performing Schools by Percentage of Overall Passing
Math Scores by Grade
Reading Scores by Grade
Scores by School Spending
Scores by School Size
Scores by School Type
(b) Analysis: There are noticeable differences in school performance across the district. These contrasts among schools appear to be influenced by several factors, including (1) school budget, (2) per capita budget, (3) student population per school, and (4) test scores in Math and Reading. The insights generated from this analysis provide a foundation for drawing specific conclusions that can guide future district-level decisions.

(c) Conclusions:
Charter schools are achieving higher test scores and a greater proportion of students passing compared to district schools, all while operating with lower budgets at both the school and per capita levels.
Schools with fewer than 2,000 students, categorized as Small (<1,000 students) and Medium (1,000-2,000 students), demonstrate significantly higher passing rates in (1) Math, (2) Reading, and (3) combined Math and Reading.

6.Ethical Concerns: This dataset contains sensitive information, including school budget details, student identifiers, and student test scores. The data was handled with care and not shared beyond the scope of this analysis
